/**
 * The KothScoreboard interface defines methods for managing the visibility of the scoreboard for players in a King of the Hill (KOTH) game mode.
 * It acts as an intermediary between the KOTH plugin and other scoreboard plugins, enabling the dynamic display of game-related information
 * on the player's scoreboard.
 *
 * Implementing this interface allows scoreboard plugins to easily integrate with KOTH game modes, providing a seamless experience for
 * players by showing or hiding scoreboards as necessary. This interface is crucial for plugins that wish to offer customizable scoreboard
 * features within the context of KOTH matches.
 *
 * <p>Note: Implementations of this interface should ensure thread-safety if scoreboards are toggled or hidden asynchronously.</p>
