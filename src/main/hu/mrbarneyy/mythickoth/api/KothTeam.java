/**
 * The KothTeam interface provides methods for interacting with team-related data within a King of the Hill (KOTH) game mode.
 * This interface serves as a bridge between the KOTH plugin and other team plugins, facilitating the retrieval of team information,
 * online players within a team, the team leader's name, and the unique team identifier.
 *
 * Implementing this interface allows for seamless integration and manipulation of team data, enhancing the KOTH gaming experience by
 * providing essential team-related functionalities. It's designed to be implemented by classes that manage team data in the context
 * of KOTH game modes.
 *
 * <p>Note: This interface requires the implementation class to be a listener to game events, as indicated by the extension of the {@code Listener} interface.</p>
