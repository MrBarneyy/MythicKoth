/**
 * The KothHologram interface specifies methods for managing holograms within a King of the Hill (KOTH) game mode.
 * It serves as a conduit between the KOTH plugin and hologram plugins, facilitating the creation, update, and removal
 * of holograms that display game-related information or visuals in the KOTH context.
 *
 * Implementing this interface allows hologram plugins to seamlessly integrate with KOTH game modes, providing a dynamic
 * and engaging player experience by visually representing game status, scores, or other relevant information through holograms.
 * This interface is crucial for plugins that aim to enhance the KOTH gameplay experience with interactive and informative holographic displays.
 *
 * <p>Note: Implementations should handle hologram lifecycle events carefully to ensure holograms are created, updated, and removed appropriately, avoiding any potential memory leaks or performance issues.</p>
